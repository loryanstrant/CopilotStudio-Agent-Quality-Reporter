"""Bundled demo dataset (per-agent shape).

Produces the same ``{"agents": [...], "default_icon_hash": ...}`` structure the live
Dataverse collector emits, so the platform can be demonstrated end-to-end without a
live connection. ``source: demo`` behaves like a live read. Each agent carries its
own owning-solution context, so solution-level rules are scored per agent.
