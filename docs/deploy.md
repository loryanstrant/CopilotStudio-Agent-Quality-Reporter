# Deploying the Copilot Studio Agent Quality Reporter

Two supported paths: a **one-click "Deploy to Azure" button** (uses prebuilt public images), and **`azd up`** (builds from source). Both land the same architecture on Azure Container Apps.

## Architecture

The deploy provisions, into a resource group of your choice:

- **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** (Burstable B1ms, 32 GB) + a database named `agentquality`.
- **Container Apps environment** with Log Analytics.
- **api** container app — external HTTPS ingress on port 8000; serves the React dashboard **and** the API, and runs database migrations on startup.
- **worker** container app — internal; runs the scheduled scan loop.

Both containers share the same secrets (database URL, Fernet key, session key, admin password) supplied as Container Apps secrets. Only an **admin password** is required at deploy time; the Postgres password and encryption keys are auto-generated.

## 1. One-click button

### For end users (deploying an existing published build)

1. Click **Deploy to Azure** in the [README](../README.md#deploy-to-azure-one-click).
2. Pick a subscription, resource group, and region.
3. Set a **dashboard admin password** (min 8 chars). Optionally expand **Entra SSO** and **Advanced**.
4. **Review + create**. Deployment takes ~5–8 minutes (Postgres is the slow part).
5. Open the **`dashboardUrl`** output, sign in with `admin` + your password, and configure the service principal in **Admin**.

### For maintainers (one-time, so the button works for everyone)

The button pulls **public** images from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Publish them once:

1. Push this repo to `https://github.com/loryanstrant/AgentQualityReporter` (branch `main`).
2. The **Publish container images** workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`) builds and pushes `api` and `worker` on every push to `main` and every `v*` tag.
3. After the first successful run, open the repo's **Packages**, and for **both** `agentqualityreporter/api` and `agentqualityreporter/worker` set the visibility to **Public** (Package settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility). Azure Container Apps then pulls them anonymously.

The image namespace is `ghcr.io/loryanstrant/agentqualityreporter/{api,worker}`; the ARM template defaults to it and to the `latest` tag.

## 2. azd (build from source)

Prefer building from your own source? Infrastructure is defined in `/infra` (`main.bicep`, `resources.bicep`) and `azure.yaml`.

```powershell
azd env set POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD "<strong-password>"
azd env set FERNET_KEY "<fernet-key>"
azd env set SECRET_KEY "<random-secret>"
azd env set ADMIN_PASSWORD "<admin-password>"

azd up      # provision + build + deploy
azd down    # tear everything down
```

## After deployment

1. Open the `dashboardUrl` output and sign in (`admin` + the password you set).
2. Go to **Admin** → follow the setup wizard to create one Entra app registration and register it as an **application user** in each Power Platform environment you want to scan.
3. Enter the **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**. Optionally add the **Azure OpenAI / Foundry** base URL, model, and key to enable the LLM instruction-quality judge.
4. **Add environment** → paste the Dataverse org URL → **Test** → **Scan now** (or **Scan all environments**).

The service principal needs the Dynamics CRM `user_impersonation` application permission and a security role that can read `bot`, `botcomponent`, and `solution` rows in each environment.

## Entra single sign-on (optional)

By default only the admin password protects the dashboard. You can additionally let colleagues sign in with their Microsoft **work account** as read-only viewers; the **Admin** console stays password-protected.

Sign-in is performed by the app itself rather than by the hosting platform, so it behaves the same on Azure Container Apps, Docker on any host, or Kubernetes. There is nothing to configure at deploy time.

1. No new app registration is needed — the service principal you already configured for scanning is reused.
2. Sign in as the admin, open **Settings**, and copy the **redirect URI** shown under *Sign in with Microsoft (optional)*. It is `https://<fqdn>/auth/oidc/callback`.
3. In the Entra portal, open that app registration → **Authentication → Add a platform → Web** and paste the redirect URI.
4. Optionally set a **report access group ID** in **Settings** to admit only members of one Entra security group, and add a **groups** claim under **Token configuration** on the app registration. Without the claim the platform falls back to an app-only Graph `checkMemberGroups` call. Non-members are refused (fail-closed).

Behind a reverse proxy the app derives its public address from `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host`. If your proxy does not send those, set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (for example `https://aqp.contoso.com`) so the redirect URI matches what you registered.

## Updating a deployment

- **One-click:** re-run the **Publish container images** workflow (or push to `main`), then in the Azure portal restart the `api` and `worker` container apps to pull the new `latest` image — or redeploy the ARM template with a specific version tag (e.g. `v0.6.0`).
- **azd:** run `azd deploy` to rebuild and roll out from source.

Database migrations run automatically on `api` startup (`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP=true`), so schema changes apply on the next revision with no manual step.
